# Group Project : GlIGHFE

GlIGHFE (pronounced Glyph-e) is a week long group project for the final week of Devacademy Aotearoa.
The idea for this project was a social media page with NO words.
We had a team of six people,  working largely in teams of two, this may explain why some have larger commits than others, but likely two people were using VScode share and working together on code.
